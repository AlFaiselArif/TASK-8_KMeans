# K-Means Clustering Project

# Objective
This project aims to perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering on a dataset.

# Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is 'C:/Users/alfai/Downloads/Iris.csv'

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps
1. Load and visualize the dataset.
2. Fit K-Means and assign cluster labels.
3. Use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.
4. Visualize the clusters with color-coding.
5. Evaluate clustering using the Silhouette Score.

# Results
- The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method.
- Clusters were visualized and evaluated.
- Silhouette Score for K=3: 0.5512

# Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the required packages:
